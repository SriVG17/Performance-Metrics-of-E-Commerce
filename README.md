## Project Structure

- data: Contains the dataset files (monthly and yearly data files).
- scripts: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration.
- output: Reports, visualizations, and summary files generated by the analysis.
- README.md: Project documentation.
- requirements.txt: List of dependencies.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans, filters, and prepares raw data for analysis.
- **Monthly and Yearly Analysis**: Aggregates data to observe monthly and yearly trends.
- **Key Performance Indicators**: Calculates key metrics such as revenue, customer acquisition cost (CAC), conversion rate, average order value (AOV), etc.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates insightful charts and dashboards to communicate trends.
- **Automated Reports**: Exports summary tables and visualizations to support decision-making.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-performance-metrics.git
cd ecommerce-performance-metrics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load Dataset**: Place your monthly and yearly data files in the `data/` folder.
2. **Run Analysis**: Execute scripts in the `scripts/` folder or open Jupyter notebooks for an interactive approach.
3. **Generate Visualizations**: Use visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Power BI to visualize trends.

### Example Commands

```bash
# Run data preprocessing
python scripts/preprocess_data.py

# Run analysis and export results
python scripts/analyze_metrics.py
```

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Revenue
   - Total revenue generated from sales within a specific time period.

### 2. Conversion Rate
   - Percentage of site visitors who make a purchase, calculated as:
   Conversion Rate=( Total Visitors/Total Sales)×100
### 3. **Average Order Value (AOV)**
   - Average revenue per order:
AOV= Total Orders/Total Revenue​

### 4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
   - Cost to acquire a new customer, based on marketing and advertising spend.

### 5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
   - Projected revenue from a customer throughout their relationship with the business.

### 6. Retention Rate
   - Percentage of customers who return for additional purchases.

### 7. Monthly Active Users (MAU)
   - Number of unique users interacting with the site within a month.

### 8. Churn Rate
   - Percentage of customers lost over a specific period.

## Data Analysis Workflow

1. Data Cleaning: Remove null values, handle duplicates, and format columns.
2. Metric Calculation: Calculate KPIs and aggregate data for monthly and yearly insights.
3. Trend Analysis: Track changes in KPIs to identify patterns, seasonality, and areas for improvement.
4. Visualization: Create time series plots, bar charts, and dashboards for intuitive insight.

## Visualization

Data visualizations are generated using:
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for Python-based plotting.
- Power BI or Tableau for dashboard creation.
  
Sample charts include:
- Monthly Revenue Trends
- Conversion Rate Comparison
- Customer Retention Analysis
  
These visuals help identify trends and patterns that aid in strategic planning.
